License: BSL 1.1

Licensor: SFF Holdings S.A.

Licensed Work: Secured Finance Contracts V1.
               The Licensed Work is (c) 2023 SFF Holdings S.A.

Additional Use Grant:

The Licensor extends the following Additional Use Grant to you (the Licensee)
in connection with the Licensed Work:

   •  The Licensee is hereby granted additional rights to utilize the
      Licensed Work in production use, without incurring any costs. This
      Additional Use Grant is subject to the following conditions:

      1. The Licensee may engage in production use of the Licensed Work,
         provided that such use does not involve offering the Licensed Work
         to third parties on a hosted or Embedded basis for the purpose of
         competing with the paid version(s) of the Licensed Work provided by
         SFF Holdings S.A.;

      2. Hosting or utilizing the Licensed Work for internal purposes within
         the Licensee's organization is not deemed a Competitive Offering.
         For the purpose of this Additional Use Grant, an organization
         includes all affiliates under direct or indirect common control with
         the Licensee; and

      3. This entire License, including the Additional Use Grant, shall
         remain in full force and effect for any use falling under this
         grant. This provision encompasses the Licensed Work and binds all
         users of the Licensed Work.

For the purposes of this License:

•  A "Competitive Offering" refers to a Product offered to third parties on a
   paid basis, including through paid support arrangements, that
   substantially overlaps with the capabilities of the Licensor’s paid
   version(s) of the Licensed Work.

•  If a Product is not considered a Competitive Offering at the time of its
   initial availability, it will not be retroactively deemed to be a
   Competitive Offering, at a later date, due to the Licensor releasing a
   new version of the Licensed Work with additional features. Furthermore,
   Products which are not provided on a paid basis, or as paid versions, are
   not deemed Competitive Offerings.

•  "Product" denotes software offered to end users either for self-management
   in their environments or as a service on a hosted basis.

•  "Embedded" means incorporating the source code or executable code from the
   Licensed Work into any Competitive Offering. It also includes packaging
   the Competitive Offering in a way that requires access or download of the
   Licensed Work for the Competitive Offering to function.

Change Date: 1 January 2026 or such earlier date on which the Licensed Work
             is made available under an Open Source license.

Change License: Version 3 or later of the GNU General Public License as
                published by the Free Software Foundation (GPL Version 3.0).
