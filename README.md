# Secured Finance Smart Contracts

## Quick Start

1. Use established node version by running `nvm use`
2. Install repository dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Run `npm run compile` to compile smart contracts
4. Execute `npm run test` to run the tests.

## Smart Contracts

Contracts written in Solidity are stored in `./contracts` directory.

## Environment variables

Please refer to `.env.sample` and create `.env` to provide secret info such as private keys, Infura ID.
Private keys are used in order to deploy smart contracts on one of the Ethereum networks.

## Compile

Run `npm run compile` to compile smart contracts. Use `npm run compile:force` command to recompile everyting if needed.

The compiled output is a json file called Artifacts and saved in `./build/contracts` directory per contract basis.
ABI and bytecode associated with the smart contract will be saved in the json file.

## Deployment

In order to deploy the protocol, run `npm run deploy <NETWORK>` command and replace with the network you want to deploy the protocol.

For example `npm run deploy hardhat` will deploy the protocol on the local hardhat version of the ethereum blockchain.

After the successful deployment you'll be able to find the deployment result in the deployments folder.

In case you want to reset and redeploy again, you can use the command `npm run deploy:force <NETWORK>`.

## Testing

### Hardhat EVM testing

1. Run `npm run test` to run all tests from `./test` directory in a local hardhat javascript EVM.

### On-chain ganache testing

1. Run `npx hardhat node` or `npm run ganache` to start a local blockchain node
2. Execute `npx hardhat test --network localhost` to run tests on a local blockchain node

In order to run the specified script, execute `npx hardhat --network <NETWORK> test "<SCRIPT PATH>"`.

For example `npx hardhat --network development test "scripts/zc-e2e.ts"` will execute the `zc-e2e` script on the develop environment.

### Security Tool testing

As of Apr 23, we use Slither and Mythril for security testing.

#### How to run Mythril
1. Run `npm run flatten`
2. Delete the duplicated file from `flattened/BeaconProxyController.sol`. hardhat flatten is not smart enough to avoid some patterns of circular dependencies. Don't worry we will fix this.
3. Run `npm run security:mythril`
4. Check the generated report named `secured-finance-mythril.json` in the project root

#### How to run Slither Analyzer
0. Install `pip3 install slither-analyzer`
1. Run `npm run flatten`
2. Delete the duplicated contract as mentioned in `How to run Mythril` section
3. Run `npm run security:slither`
4. Check the generated report named `secured-finance-slither.txt` in the project root

As of now, Slither will refer to the flatten contracts rather than ones in `build`. This might affect the slither behavior: generating duplicated messages, etc.

## Publishing

This package is published automatically by workflows when the PR is merged into develop branch or main branch. The package version will be updated by the workflow.
Versioning is executed as follows

```
In case that current version is 0.0.1
-> After merging into develop: 0.0.2-beta.0
-> After merging into main: 0.0.2

In case that current version is 0.0.1-beta.0
-> After merging into develop: 0.0.1-beta.1
-> After merging into main: 0.0.1
```

If you want to update the major version or minor version, you need to update it manually.

## Tasks

Under the task folder, there are the scripts below which are run using the Hardhat task.

In order to generate documents, run `npm run docgen`.

The following documents are automatically generated by the code generator from Solidity comments under the [./docs](./docs) folder.
